This repository contains a simple TypeScript example demonstrating a common type error. The `add` function expects two numbers as arguments, but the code attempts to pass a string. This results in a type error during compilation, highlighting TypeScript's type safety features. The solution shows how to prevent this error by ensuring that the arguments passed to the function are indeed numbers.
